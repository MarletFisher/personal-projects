  <h3>Our Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    We process your personal information to run our business and provide our
    users with the Services. By accepting our Terms of Use (and in some
    jurisdictions, by acknowledging this policy), you confirm that you have read
    and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.
    If you don’t want us to collect or process your personal information in the
    ways described in this policy, you shouldn’t use the Services. We are not
    responsible for the content or the privacy policies or practices of any of
    our members, websites hosted through Pattern by Etsy, or third-party
    websites and apps. Etsy’s Terms of Use require all account owners to be at
    least 18 years of age. Minors under 18 years of age and at least 13 years of
    age are permitted to use Etsy's Services only if they have permission and
    direct supervision by the owner of the account. Children under age 13 are
    not permitted to use the Services. You are responsible for any and all
    account activity conducted by a minor on your account. We do not knowingly
    “sell”, as that term is defined under applicable law, including the
    California Consumer Privacy Act, the personal information of minors. More
    information can be found in Etsy’s Minors Policy. By using the Services, you
    acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States,
    Ireland and any other country where Etsy operates. Please be aware that the
    privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of
    authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that
    apply in the country in which you reside. We will transfer personal
    information only to those countries to which we are permitted by law to
    transfer personal information as more fully described in the "Transfers"
    Section of this policy.
